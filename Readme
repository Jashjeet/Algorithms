Dynamic Programming
The input for this problem consists of two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10 and a sequence of distinct numbers c1 < c2 < ... < ck, where each ci is an integer between 1 and 10. Your program needs to output the number of ways one can write n as a sum of integers from the set {c1,c2,...,ck}. You only have to output the number of diﬀerent partitions, not the partitions themselves. Furthermore, you can output either (the choice is up to you): • The number itself (note, that it can be very large). • The last digit of this number (note that in this case it suﬃces to always take the recurrence mod 10 in each step).
Run your program for the following ﬁve inputs: 1. n = 103, k = 2, c1 = 1,c2 = 2. 2. n = 103, k = 3, c1 = 1,c2 = 3,c3 = 5. 3. n = 2·103, k = 3, c1 = 2,c2 = 3,c3 = 5. 4. n = 103, k = 10, c1 = 1,c2 = 2,c3 = 3,c4 = 4,c5 = 5,c6 = 6,c7 = 7,c8 = 8,c9 = 9,c10 = 10. 5. n = 2·103, k = 4, c1 = 2, c2 = 4, c3 = 5, c4 = 6.

Example: Input: n = 5,k = 3,c1 = 1,c2 = 3,c3 = 4.
Output: 6.
Partitions:
1. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
2. 1 + 1 + 3
3. 1 + 3 + 1
4. 3 + 1 + 1
5. 4 + 1
6. 1 + 4
